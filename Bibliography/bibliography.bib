ABSTRACT = {Large language models (LLMs) have had a significant impact on several domains, including software engineering. However, a comprehensive understanding of LLMs’ use, impact, and potential limitations in software engineering is still emerging and remains in its early stages. This paper analyzes the role of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT-3.5, in software requirements engineering, a critical area in software engineering experiencing rapid advances due to artificial intelligence (AI). By analyzing several studies, we systematically evaluate the integration of ChatGPT into software requirements engineering, focusing on its benefits, challenges, and ethical considerations. This evaluation is based on a comparative analysis that highlights ChatGPT’s efficiency in eliciting requirements, accuracy in capturing user needs, potential to improve communication among stakeholders, and impact on the responsibilities of requirements engineers. The selected studies were analyzed for their insights into the effectiveness of ChatGPT, the importance of human feedback, prompt engineering techniques, technological limitations, and future research directions in using LLMs in software requirements engineering. This comprehensive analysis aims to provide a differentiated perspective on how ChatGPT can reshape software requirements engineering practices and provides strategic recommendations for leveraging ChatGPT to effectively improve the software requirements engineering process.},

  title    = "Value-based requirements engineering: method and experience",
  author   = "Thew, Sarah and Sutcliffe, Alistair",
  abstract = "`Socio-political' issues, such as emotions, values and people's
              feelings, are often cited as problems in the RE process. A method
              is described for analysing such issues. The method consists of a
              taxonomy of stakeholders' values, motivations and emotions (VME),
              with process guidance for eliciting and analysing these issues
              for the RE process and design implications. Values are personal
              attitudes or long-term beliefs which may influence stakeholder
              functional and non-functional requirements. Motivations are
              psychological constructs related to personality traits which may
              be viewed as stakeholders' long-term goals in RE. Emotions are
              cues to stakeholders' reactions arising from value/motivation
              conflicts. The method is supported by a website which illustrates
              the taxonomy with explanations and scenarios describing problems
              arising from value conflicts, and from poor understanding of
              stakeholder values. Two method validation studies were
              undertaken: first, an evaluation of the website and method by
              novices and RE experts; and second, case study applications of RE
              value analysis in real-world industrial practice. The method was
              used by all practitioners, although in different ways, some used
              it to create an agenda of issues for analysis while others
              employed the VMEs to interpret stakeholders' views and manage
              stakeholder negotiations. The validation studies provide evidence
              for the acceptability of the method for industrial practitioners,
              illustrating how value-related problems are identified and
              analysed effectively by the method. The utility of analysing VMEs
              is compared to other `socio-political issues'-oriented methods in
              RE and methods which focus on monetized values in product
              requirements.",

The growing impact of these systems has also highlighted potential issues that may arise from their utilization, such as data privacy issues, resulting in calls for ethical AI systems. Yet, how to develop ethical AI systems remains an important question in the area. How should the principles and values be converted into requirements for these systems, and what should developers and the organizations developing these systems do? To further bridge this gap in the area, in this paper, we present a method for implementing AI ethics: ECCOLA. Following a cyclical action research approach, ECCOLA has been iteratively developed over the course of multiple years, in collaboration with both researchers and practitioners.}

However, some SPIDe studies indicated that it is also possible to elicit requirements through its application due to its participatory characteristics. In this paper, we present an investigation about the feasibility of using SPIDe for requirements elicitation, presenting an exploratory case study of requirements elicitation integrated into interaction design. The data was collected in logbooks, semi-structured interviews, a technology acceptance model questionnaire, and analyzed using thematic analysis. The results show that the use of SPIDe for requirements elicitation integrated into interaction design is feasible. Besides that, they indicate some improvements to the overall process.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used as a key component of most software systems, yet serious concerns have been raised about the fairness of ML predictions. Researchers have been proposing novel methods to support the development of fair machine learning solutions. Nonetheless, most of them can only be used in late development stages, e.g., during model training, while there is a lack of methods that may provide practitioners with early fairness analytics enabling the treatment of fairness throughout the development lifecycle. This paper proposes ReFair, a novel context-aware requirements engineering framework that allows to classify sensitive features from User Stories. By exploiting natural language processing and word embedding techniques, our framework first identifies both the use case domain and the machine learning task to be performed in the system being developed; afterward, it recommends which are the context-specific sensitive features to be considered during the implementation. We assess the capabilities of ReFair by experimenting it against a synthetic dataset---which we built as part of our research---composed of 12,401 User Stories related to 34 application domains. Our findings showcase the high accuracy of ReFair, other than highlighting its current limitations.},

It is crucial to prepare upcoming software engineers with the abilities to specify high-quality requirements for AI-based systems. Goal: This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE), specifically the KAOS method, in facilitating requirements elicitation for AI-based systems within an educational context. Method: We conducted an empirical study in an introductory software engineering class, combining presentations, practical exercises, and a survey to assess students’ experience using GORE. Results: The analysis revealed that GORE is particularly effective in capturing high-level requirements, such as user expectations and system necessity. However, it is less effective for detailed planning, such as ensuring privacy and handling errors. The majority of students were able to apply the KAOS methodology correctly or with minor inadequacies, indicating its usability and effectiveness in educational settings. Students identified several benefits of GORE, including its goal-oriented nature and structured approach, which facilitated the management of complex requirements. However, challenges such as determining goal refinement stopping criteria and managing diagram complexity were also noted. Conclusion: GORE shows significant potential for enhancing requirements elicitation in AI-based systems. While generally effective, the approach could benefit from additional support and resources to address identified challenges. These findings suggest that GORE can be a valuable tool in both educational and practical contexts, provided that enhancements are made to facilitate its application.},

abstract = {A growing range of applications use AI and other autonomous agents to perform tasks that raise social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and cultural (SLEEC) concerns. To support a framework for the consideration of these concerns, we introduce SLEEC-TK, a toolkit for specification, validation, and verification of SLEEC requirements. SLEEC-TK is an Eclipse-based environment for defining SLEEC rules in a domain-specific language with a timed process algebraic semantics. SLEEC-TK uses model checking to identify redundant and conflicting rules, and to verify conformance of design models with SLEEC rules. We illustrate the use of SLEEC-TK for an assistive-care robot.}

abstract={This paper explores the evolving relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and human creativity through two distinct yet interconnected perspectives: contemporary insights on AI's cognitive capabilities and philosophical foundations of creativity. In the first part, it examines the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in replicating human thought and creativity, emphasizing the importance of embodied cognition, emotional depth, and ethical considerations surrounding AI-generated content. Key findings from neuroscience and studies on algorithm aversion highlight the necessity of maintaining human authenticity in creative practices. The second part draws on influential thinkers such as Rollo May, Judith Butler, Kimberl{\'e} Crenshaw, and bell hooks to underscore the deeply personal and relational dimensions of creativity that AI cannot replicate. It discusses concepts such as courage, performativity, intersectionality, and emotional intelligence, illuminating the complexities of human identity and expression. The paper concludes with recommendations aimed at fostering collaboration between AI and human creators, developing ethical guidelines, and enhancing critical literacy regarding AI technologies. By synthesizing these perspectives, the paper underscores the need to recognize and preserve the unique qualities of human creativity in an increasingly AI-influenced landscape, inviting thoughtful engagement with the intersection of human expression and technological innovation.},

abstract = {The growing presence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in various sectors necessitates systems that accurately reflect societal diversity. This study seeks to envision the operationalization of the ethical imperatives of diversity and inclusion (D&I) within AI ecosystems, addressing the current disconnect between ethical guidelines and their practical implementation. A significant challenge in AI development is the effective operationalization of D&I principles, which is critical to prevent the reinforcement of existing biases and ensure equity across AI applications. This paper proposes a vision of a framework for developing a tool utilizing persona-based simulation by Generative AI (GenAI). The approach aims to facilitate the representation of the needs of diverse users in the requirements analysis process for AI software. The proposed framework is expected to lead to a comprehensive persona repository with diverse attributes that inform the development process with detailed user narratives. This research contributes to the development of an inclusive AI paradigm that ensures future technological advances are designed with a commitment to the diverse fabric of humanity.},
